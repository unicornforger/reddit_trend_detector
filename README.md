# reddit_trend_detector
I am building a tool to track and analyze trending content on Reddit. The tool will fetch popular and highly upvoted posts from various subreddits, aggregate trends, and provide analytics on what topics are gaining traction. The data will be used for research, reporting, and possibly to inform content creators about current trends.
I intend to use listing endpoints such as /r/all/hot, /r/all/top, /r/{subreddit}/hot, and /r/{subreddit}/top to fetch trending posts. I may also use endpoints for subreddit discovery and post details as needed
